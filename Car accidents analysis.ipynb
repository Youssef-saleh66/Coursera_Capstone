    "This project is a capstone project for Data analysis course on Corsera, which is set up by IBM. During this project a dataset of car accidents will be analysed using Python. The dataset has many attributes which would provide us with a wide range of information on different circumstances of accidents. First, the data will be analysed to understand the attributes and which information would be useful for our analysis. Then the most suitable machine learning technique would be chosen to set up a model to predict future accidents. Finally, the model will be deployed and tested to check the accuracy of the set up model."

    "Car accidents is a serious problem and lead to heavy losses on both human lives and money. During recent years and with the advancments in technology and safety in cars, nomber of fatalities has been decreasing continiously. Also the safety and organizational parameters for traffic have been conducted by many governments, which also helped a lot in decreasing the nomber of accidents. However, there are still accidents and they are not completely prevented till now. Hence, it would be a great advantage to be able to predict the most common type of accidents and their respective severity, so that we concentrate our efforts on these severe types of accidents and try to minimize them. Therefore a dataset is being analysed during this notebook and then a model will be created which will predict the severity of car accidents depending on a wide range of significant attributes."

    "The target of this project is accidents severity, hence a labeled dataset with accidents severity types is needed and of course various attributes to create a more inclusive model. There are many sources to get such dataset, however a sample dataset provided by Corsera will be used during the course of this notebook and can be found <a href='https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv'>here</a>. The dataset consists of all types of accidents in the city of Seattle since the year 2004. It has 38 attributes, 194673 observations and contains attribute for accidents severity (our target). Moreover, the significance of attributes will be assessed and then chosen accordingly. The unused attributes will be droped out of our dataset and the missing values will be dealt with during preprocessing. Since grouping of already labeled accidents severity is the objective, Classification learning algorithm will be implemented (Supervised learning) to create the intended model. "
